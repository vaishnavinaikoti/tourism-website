Aptly nicknamed “Radelaide” by locals, Adelaide has a vibrant street art scene that has even been recognised alongside some of the world’s biggest cities as a hot destination for public art. Adelaide locals flock to Peel Street in the city centre for its thriving string of bars and restaurants. Delve into the tasting menu at Peel St, and then get cosy at Maybe Mae, an Art Deco cocktail den accessed through the subway tunnel between Leigh and Peel streets. Around the corner, graffiti-splashed Anster Street is also home to some trendy bars. Be sure to also visit Rhino Room on Pirie Street, Morphett Street Bridge, Little Rundle Street and Wonderwalls project in Port Adelaide - home to some of the city’s street art highlights.

 Melbourne is renowned as one of the world's street art capitals, and residents are encouraged to participate in creative expression. Hosier and Rutledge lanes (opposite Federation Square in the city centre) and Centre Place are among the most colourful spots, creating some of the city's best open-air galleries. Join a street art tour to discover hidden treasures off the beaten track. The rest of the state is following Melbourne’s artistic lead with the development of a 200 kilometre (124 mile) Silo Art Trail. You’ll see towering works created by internationally recognised street artists, starting in the Grampians. The road trip will take you through six of the region’s smallest towns which now make up one of the country’s biggest outdoor art galleries. Visit the quaint towns, boutique shops and cafes of Australia’s wheatbelt along the way.
