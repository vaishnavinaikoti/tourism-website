When: Late January – April
Where: Bremer Bay, Western Australia

If you haven’t heard of Bremer Bay, you’re probably not alone - it’s only been a few years since this tiny community on the remote south coast of Western Australia was thrust into the eco-tourism spotlight with the discovery of the ‘Bremer Canyon’. In a nutshell, the Bremer Canyon is a series of oceanic rifts 70 kilometres (43 miles) from shore which funnel cool, nutrient-rich waters upwards, attracting an abundance of marine life. While photos and newspaper clippings of this local phenomenon have adorned the walls of the Bremer Bay pub for decades, the hype only set in when ABC documentary ‘The Search for the Ocean's Super Predator’ was aired in 2013. The program revealed a deep-sea battlefield that takes place every autumn, where apex predators including orcas, giant squid and great white sharks come to feast each year. Orcas are the highlight – you can join a daily research boat tour where the sighting rate is 98% – making it a highly reliable expedition and one of the largest congregations of killer whales in the southern hemisphere.

Tip: Pre-book overnight accommodation in Bremer Bay so you’re ready for the early wake up call.

Swim with the Giant Cuttlefish is a tour in South Australia that takes you snorkelling with the amazing giant cuttlefish at Stony Point, located on the coastline of the Upper Spencer Gulf Marine Park in the Eyre Peninsula. Their two-day tour itinerary, which has departures available to book during the cuttlefish migration season in July, is packed with added benefits that include exclusive cuttlefish insights by a marine expert, sightseeing through the wilderness of the Southern Flinders Ranges and hiking along the rugged Alligator Gorge in the Mount Remarkable National Park.
