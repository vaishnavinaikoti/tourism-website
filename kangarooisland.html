<p>Kangaroo Island is one of the world's great nature-based destinations.  Think of an island with 509km of Coastline & 155km from the East Coast to the West Coast. With native bushland, wildlife, adventure & exploring. Where pristine beaches, local wines & sunsets are on your doorstep. You'll need longer than you think!
 

"There really aren't enough adjectives to accurately describe the beauty of Kangaroo Island. In fact, words can almost spoil the moment. Even photos don't do this wildly gorgeous destination justice". Isaac Bober, Symmetry, Australia.</p>

Kangaroo Island has really missed you!  The region has taken a big hit, ​with the bushfires and COVID-19 all but closing down the Islands attractions, experiences and limiting our food and beverage offerings to take-away.

Our community continues to come together.  While our experiences may have changed slightly for your safety through COVID-19, the best of Kangaroo Island is still here.  If you crave open spaces and natural beauty, then this is the place for you.  Stunning beaches and coastlines, interesting walks and hikes, kayaking, fishing, and camping, at the best time of the year.  The days are beautiful, the pastures are green, at night stoke up a fire outside, and get together with mates to have a laugh and enjoy life.   Our restaurants and cellar doors are begining to open, it will be a great time to revisit those we have missed, or to discover something new for the first time. 

​While the affected bushfire areas is​​ taking​ some time to recover,  there is some amazing regeneration.

We have put together some amazing offers to #WelcomeBack to Kangaroo Island. So here are a whole host of reasons to, #HolidayHereThisYear.

Descendents of Islanders who have farmed the land and fished the seas for generations, have a determination and ingenuity that has been born from isolation, that continues through the generations.

 
As one of the world's best nature-based destinations, discovering our natural attractions is on the top of everyones list.  So to are visiting our wildlife, where you don't have to go far off the beaten track to see them the way they were meant to be seen - in the wild.  Make sure you put aside time to take a walk or hike through our environment - it is spectacular in every season.

Naturally enough, being surrounded by fertile lands and rich waters, Kangaroo Island produces some of Australia's finest foods and beverages, and we are famous for our honey, seafood, eggs, olives, wines and spirits.
