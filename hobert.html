GUIDE TO HOBERT</h2>
<h3>With daring art, a dynamic food scene and a wealth of natural attractions, Hobart is a small city with big ideas.</h3>

 </div>
<div>
<p>The culinary scene in Hobart is a champion of local produce, with fantastic restaurants around every corner. Join the locals along the popular dining strips in historic Salamanca or North Hobart. Or choose from a selection of quality city and waterfront restaurants. Along the city's docks, try South American-inspired Frank, or fine dining over the water at Aloft.</p>

Marvel at MONA

Board a ferry at Hobart's Brooke Street Pier and sail upstream to the daring Museum of Old and New Art, or MONA. Australia's largest privately owned museum is cut into sandstone cliffs in the northern suburbs, with an art collection as eclectic as it is provocative. The food might almost qualify as art at MONA's onsite restaurant, Source. Directly beneath the restaurant is the cellar door for MONA's Moorilla winery, with wines produced from the vineyards that adjoin the gallery. Be sure to try MONA's Moo Brew beer range while here also.

Climb Mount Wellington

Take a 30-minute drive from the city centre to reach the summit of Mount Wellington, almost 1300 metres (4265 feet) above the city. The view of Hobart and its surrounds is exceptional. Grab a coffee halfway up the mountain at the Bentwood Coffee caravan, and make a stop at Australia's oldest brewery, Cascade, on the way back down. If you're feeling energetic, you'll find access to walking tracks and beautiful scenery below the summit at the Springs. The Springs is also equipped with picnic facilities and toilets.
