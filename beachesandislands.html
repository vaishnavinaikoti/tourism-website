BEACHES AND ISLANDS</h2>
<h3>Go beyond well-known destinations to discover Australia’s beach and island gems. You’ll soon learn why the sand and sea hold such a special place in our national identity.</h3>
 </div>
<div>
<p>From city beaches to secluded spots where you’ll share the sand with more wildlife than humans, there are gorgeous beaches and islands across the country. Sail through the Whitsundays, marvel at a sea of red crabs on Christmas Island or embark on a coastal drive in search of the perfect spot for a surf. It won't take long to find.</p>

<p>Rottnest Island

Rottnest Island, just a short ferry ride from Perth, has one tiny attraction you can’t see anywhere else. The quokka, a pint-sized marsupial, is known for its friendly nature, which is why photographers love to snap their picture. The island is a true sanctuary: private cars are not allowed, so most visitors explore the place on foot or by bicycle, wandering between 63 charming beaches with snorkels in hand. Families will love the Just 4 Fun Aqua Park, and there are some great places to scuba dive. If you’re keen to cover the entire island, the hop-on hop-off Island Explorer bus is a great option. Stay in a luxury eco-tent nestled behind the sand dunes.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands
This idyllic Indian Ocean outpost of 27 islands boasts dazzling white-sand beaches, world-class diving and a unique cultural blend – yet it receives only a handful of visitors each year, perhaps due to its remote location off Australia’s west coast. Those who do make the trip from Perth (via Christmas Island) will be handsomely rewarded: divers of all abilities can marvel at coral reefs and shipwrecks with Cocos Dive; curious historians can take a guided tour to learn about the local Cocos Malay people; and explorers can visit the territory’s untouched southern islands on an outrigger canoe safari. Don’t miss calm Cossies Beach on Direction Island; it’s been called Australia’s best beach.</p>

Tiwi Islands

The Tiwi Islands, located 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of Darwin, overflow with culture, art and beauty. Take a tour with AAT Kings and be welcomed with a smoking ceremony before watching Tiwi women weave baskets and learn some of the complex rituals associated with the Pukamani (burial ceremony). Avid anglers will love a guided sport-fishing experience with Tiwi Island Adventures; there are more than 40 fish species to catch. Be sure to watch a match of the island’s biggest passion - Australian rules football. Seven teams play from October to March, and there are huge festivities each year for the grand final.
