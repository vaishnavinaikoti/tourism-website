Get up close and personal to the animals at the zoo

Visit the animals at Taronga Zoo Sydney with their incredible waterside address just a 12-minute ferry ride north from Circular Quay. Taronga Zoo Sydney houses more than 4,000 animals both native and exotic, including gorillas, tigers, leopards, chimpanzees, giraffes, Australian sea lions, kangaroos and koalas. Once you’ve been up close with the animals, experience the wildlife from a new perspective by tackling the treetop Wild Ropes – more than 60 high rope challenges over four courses, including zip-lines, rope climbs and suspended bridges. For the ultimate sleepover, book the Roar and Snore experience, allowing you to stay in safari-style tents at the zoo and encounter animals up close.

 Spend the day at the Sydney Opera House

There are many ways you can experience what the Sydney Opera House has to offer. A masterpiece of 20th-century architecture, the Sydney Opera House in Circular Quay hosts more than 40 performances each week. Book tickets to Opera Australia’s latest show and tick this truly iconic Sydney experience off your bucket list. If what happens off-stage intrigues you, sign up for a two-hour backstage tour, which takes guests behind-the-scenes into the exclusive domain of performers, with a full cooked breakfast in the green room. Tours operate daily at 7am. To cap it all off, dine overlooking the harbour at Peter Gilmore’s restaurant Bennelong - one of Australia's most awarded fine dining restaurants.
