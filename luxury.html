From the food and wine to the accommodation and natural scenery, Australia is a destination of extraordinary experiences. Swim through serene waters with whale sharks and stroll through giant karri trees before falling asleep in a luxe lodge and waking up to a sunrise over the majestic red dirt of the outback. In every corner of the country you’ll find extravagant experiences you’ll never forget.

Vivid Sydney

Vivid Sydney sees one of Australia’s liveliest cities come alive in a festival of light, music and ideas. As the sun goes down, the skyline illuminates in bright colours, the facades of waterfront venues dance with vibrant projections and the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge join in the city-wide kaleidoscope. Attend thought-provoking events, walk through artistic installations or perhaps grab the best seat in the house - a place on the water of Sydney Harbour. Charter a super yacht for a luxury experience of the dazzling cityscape.

 Paspaley Pearls

Paspaley Pearls are some of the rarest and most valuable in the world. In both Sydney and Darwin, you can experience the country’s most exquisite pearls differently. In Sydney, join The Tailor in a visit to Paspaley’s flagship boutique, where you’ll step into a highly secure elevator before being escorted to The Pearl Room. It is in this room, not open to the general public, where South Sea pearls are graded and hand-matched to create Paspaley’s unrivalled strands. You may also have the privilege of viewing the Paspaley family’s private collection before you indulge in the rare chance to try pearl meat. In Darwin, you’ll embark on a behind-the-scenes tour of The Pearl Room, enjoy a private viewing at the boutique and even have the opportunity to explore the Pearl Farms on a day trip - an experience limited to a select number of guests.
