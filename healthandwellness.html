In Australia, you can embrace the wellbeing of your body, mind and soul. Not only can you focus on wellness within world-class spas and health retreats, but you can also reconnect with yourself and with nature on Aboriginal culture walks or within remote accommodation. Indulge in a body clay ritual or practice yoga next to crashing ocean waves as you take a wellness journey through Australia.

Gaia Retreat & Spa, in the lush Byron Bay hinterland of northern New South Wales, comes with a celebrity connection (Grease star, Olivia Newton-John, is a co-founder). The day spa, with 14 treatment rooms and more than 35 healers and therapists, is central to the pampering Gaia experience. After starting the day with yoga, choose from activities that include clay sculpture or Let's Get Physical fitness and boxing. Meals draw on Gaia's own organic garden and, at dinner, guests can even enjoy a glass of organic wine.
