The Australian spin on gin

Sydney started it all with the opening of Archie Rose Distillery, which was shortly followed by a spattering of others taking their own spin on spirits. Poor Toms Gin Hall is the quintessential experimental hipster outfit, and if you prefer rum over gin, you’ll find that in Sydney, too. Brix Distillers in Surry Hills creates spiced rums just minutes from the city centre.

Little Lon Distilling Co., housed in Melbourne centre’s last remaining single-story house, makes small-batch gins that raise a tipple to the delightful deviants who once trod the lurid laneways of the city’s north-east corner. Brogan’s Way, in the suburb of Richmond, is proudly led by a female master distiller who got her start as a medical laboratory scientist. Using Australian botanicals, the gins created here are designed to challenge the conventional ideas of what gin should be like.
Adelaide may be best known for its surrounding wine regions, but that hasn’t stopped budding alchemists from experimenting with small-batch gins and rums. Prohibition Liquor Co. was inspired by the bootleggers of the prohibition era, but they’ve taken the artisan route to create a premium product. Twenty Third Street Distillery on Melbourne is a new outlet for the Renmark stalwart, allowing city dwellers to experience the craftsmanship behind the resurrected distillery (originally built in 1914) in the Murray River region.
