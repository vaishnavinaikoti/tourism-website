Visit the Great Barrier Reef in style on board Ocean Spirit, a 32-metre (105-foot), high-performance catamaran. It sails daily from Cairns to Michaelmas Cay, a stunning reef sand island. You can dive and snorkel the reef among the turtles and colourful fish, lie on the deck and soak up the sun or enjoy a glass-bottomed boat tour. Michaelmas Cay is also home to more than 23 species of seabird and is one of the most significant bird sanctuaries on the Great Barrier Reef.
Create the perfect romantic surprise for a loved one by flying over the world-famous natural wonder, Heart Reef. From above, you'll not only marvel at the pure turquoise waters, but also see the composition of coral that has naturally shaped itself into a heart. This scenic flight is just one of the tours offered by Air Whitsunday and GSL Aviation, with the white silica sand of Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island also on the menu.
